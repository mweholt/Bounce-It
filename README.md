* Description: This is our modified version of the classic game of Pong, called "Bounce It"*
* In Bounce It, the point of the game is to keep the ball bouncing in the game board for as*
* long as possible. To do so, the player must hit the spacebar at the correct time in order*
* to conver the dashed line into a solid one. The line will only remain solid for so long, *
* so the player must be careful not to convert the wall too soon or too late. Every time   *
* the ball hits the players converted wall, a point will be added to the total score.      *
* If the player does not conver the wall in time, the ball will slip past the dashed line  *
* and the game will be over! The player can attempt again by starting the game over.       *
* Try to see how long you can Bounce It!                                                   *
